        <h1 id="Dodgers-look-to-clinch-NL-West-crown-as-they-host-Rockies"><a href="#Dodgers-look-to-clinch-NL-West-crown-as-they-host-Rockies" class="headerlink" title="Dodgers look to clinch NL West crown as they host Rockies"></a>Dodgers look to clinch NL West crown as they host Rockies</h1><p>The Los Angeles Dodgers continue their march to their sixth consecutive NL West division title. The Dodgers will clinch the title with a win over the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>The Dodgers got some help on Monday night from the Arizona Diamondbacks, who beat the San Francisco Giants, 10-8. That gave the Dodgers a six-game lead over the Giants with eight games remaining in the season.</p>
<p>Manager Dave Roberts has been using a variety of lineups in order to keep his players fresh down the stretch. Cody Bellinger did not start on Monday night, but he came off the bench and hit a go-ahead two-run homer in the eighth inning.</p>
<p>Yu Darvish, who is scheduled to start on Tuesday night, is 3-4 with a 4.01 ERA in 11 starts since being traded to the Dodgers at the deadline. He will be facing German Marquez, who is 10-5 with a 4.38 ERA in 23 starts this season.</p>
<p>Rockies first baseman Ian Desmond expects a tough battle against the Dodgers. “You’re playing against one of the best teams in baseball,” Desmond said. “It’s going to be a good challenge for us.”</p>
<h1 id="Kershaw-in-good-form-ahead-of-crucial-game-against-Rockies"><a href="#Kershaw-in-good-form-ahead-of-crucial-game-against-Rockies" class="headerlink" title="Kershaw in good form ahead of crucial game against Rockies"></a>Kershaw in good form ahead of crucial game against Rockies</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Clayton Kershaw will take the mound for the Dodgers on Friday night looking to lead his team to a victory over the Rockies that would clinch first place in the NL West. Kershaw has been in good form of late, with a 3-0 record and a 2.53 ERA over his last four starts.</p>
<p>The Rockies have been hot lately as well, so Friday’s game should be a close contest. If the Dodgers can manage to win, it would give them a huge advantage going into the final weeks of the season.</p>
<p>Kershaw is one of the best pitchers in baseball and he will certainly be motivated to win on Friday night. He is sure to give everything he has against the Rockies in order to help lead his team to victory.</p>
<h1 id="Dodgers’-rookies-fuel-late-season-charge-for-playoffs"><a href="#Dodgers’-rookies-fuel-late-season-charge-for-playoffs" class="headerlink" title="Dodgers’ rookies fuel late-season charge for playoffs"></a>Dodgers’ rookies fuel late-season charge for playoffs</h1><p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have surged in the second half of the season and are now in prime contention for a playoff berth. Much of this late-season success can be attributed to the emergence of several rookies who have injected new life into the team.</p>
<p>One such rookie is Cody Bellinger, who was called up from the minors in April. Bellinger has been a force at the plate, hitting 39 home runs and driving in 97 runs. He has also displayed surprising speed on the base paths, stealing 14 bases.</p>
<p>Another rookie who has made a big impact for the Dodgers is Walker Buehler. Buehler was called up in May and has been a dominant pitcher, posting a 12-4 record with an impressive 2.62 ERA.</p>
<p>Other Dodgers rookies who have played a key role in the team’s revival include Kyle Farmer, Max Muncy, and Alex Verdugo. The infusion of youthful energy these players have brought to the Dodgers lineup has helped them become one of the most feared teams in baseball as they make their push for the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Seager-returns-guides-Dodgers-to-win-over-Phillies"><a href="#Seager-returns-guides-Dodgers-to-win-over-Phillies" class="headerlink" title="Seager returns, guides Dodgers to win over Phillies"></a>Seager returns, guides Dodgers to win over Phillies</h1><p>Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Corey Seager returned to the lineup on Tuesday and had a huge impact, going 2-for-4 with a three-run homer in a 10-5 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies.</p>
<p>It was Seager’s first game since April 11, as he had been out with a hamstring injury.</p>
<p>“I felt really good,” Seager said of his return. “The biggest thing is just trying to not do too much. I think I did a pretty good job of that tonight. Just trying to get back into the swing of things. The home run was definitely a bonus.”</p>
<p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts was certainly happy to have Seager back in the fold.</p>
<p>“That was huge, obviously, for us tonight,” Roberts said of Seager’s homer. “To get him going offensively and then defensively at shortstop — he looked pretty comfortable there tonight. It was good to have Corey back.”</p>
<p>The Dodgers (16-10) have now won five consecutive games and six of their last seven contests.</p>
<h1 id="Bellinger-powers-Dodgers-past-Padres-for-sixth-consecutive-win"><a href="#Bellinger-powers-Dodgers-past-Padres-for-sixth-consecutive-win" class="headerlink" title="Bellinger powers Dodgers past Padres for sixth consecutive win"></a>Bellinger powers Dodgers past Padres for sixth consecutive win</h1><h1 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>The Dodgers extended their winning streak to six games with a 5-2 victory over the Padres on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Third baseman Justin Turner led the way for Los Angeles, going 2 for 4 with a home run and two RBIs. Catcher Yasmani Grandal also went deep, knocking a solo homer in the seventh inning.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, outfielder Cody Bellinger continued his torrid pace at the plate, going 2 for 3 with an RBI and two runs scored. Bellinger now has nine homers and 20 RBIs on the season, both of which lead the team.</p>
<p>Dodgers starting pitcher Rich Hill pitched six innings of one-run ball, striking out eight while only allowing three hits. He has now allowed two or fewer runs in each of his last four starts.</p>
<p>Kenley Jansen got the save in relief, pitching a scoreless ninth inning.</p>
