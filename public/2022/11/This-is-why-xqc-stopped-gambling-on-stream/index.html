<p>There’s no doubt that xqc is one of the best players in the world when it comes to competitive Overwatch. But his skills extend beyond the game itself – he’s also become known for his entertaining and informative live streams.</p>
<p>However, it seems that xqc’s success as a streamer may have come at a cost. In a recent blog post, xqc claims that he has stopped gambling on stream because it’s too hard to resist the urge to bet when people are watching.</p>
<p>xqc isn’t the only streamer to grapple with this issue. Recently, poksinonicon announced that he was taking a break from streaming while he deals with his own gambling addiction. Poksinonicon is one of the most popular Korean streamers, and his story highlights the fact that this is a problem which affects players of all levels of experience and skill.</p>
<p>So why is gambling such a temptation for streamers? There are likely multiple factors at play here, but one of the main reasons is probably the sense of social pressure. When you’re streaming, you’re essentially putting yourself on display for your viewers. This can create a lot of pressure to perform, and it can be difficult to resist the temptation to gamble in an attempt to boost your viewer numbers or keep them entertained.</p>
<p>In addition, there’s also the fact that gambling can be addictive. This is especially true if you’re someone who enjoys taking risks, as many gamers do. Gambling can provide a rush which is difficult to replicate elsewhere, and it’s easy to get caught up in the thrill of betting your money on something uncertain.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, gambling is never worth risking your financial stability or your mental health. If you’re struggling with an addiction to gambling, please seek professional help – there is no shame in admitting that you need help dealing with this issue.</p>
<h1 id="Why-did-xqc-stop-gambling-on-stream"><a href="#Why-did-xqc-stop-gambling-on-stream" class="headerlink" title="Why did xqc stop gambling on stream?"></a>Why did xqc stop gambling on stream?</h1><p>Xqc, a professional Canadian gamer, who is known for his skills in the popular first-person shooter game “Destiny 2”, has stopped gambling on his live stream. The decision to stop gambling came after xqc was given a 4-week suspension from competitive gaming by developer Bungie for “ Destiny 2” for repeatedly throwing matches and abusing other players.</p>
<p>Gambling has been a big part of xqc’s live stream since he started streaming in September of 2017. He would often gamble with his viewers on items such as skins, emotes, and even game content. In one incident, xqc lost a $1000 bet to a viewer on a game of “Call of Duty”. </p>
<p>It is unclear why xqc has decided to stop gambling on his stream. Some people are speculating that it may have something to do with him being banned from competitive play. Others are saying that it could be because of the negative attention that gambling can bring to him and his channel. </p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, we can only hope that xqc will continue to stream and entertain us with his antics.</p>
<h1 id="What-caused-xqc-to-stop-gambling-on-stream"><a href="#What-caused-xqc-to-stop-gambling-on-stream" class="headerlink" title="What caused xqc to stop gambling on stream?"></a>What caused xqc to stop gambling on stream?</h1><p>Drama has always followed professional gamers and streamers around. From Keemstar’s Drama Alert to the more recent drama between FaZe Clan and TSM, there is always something going on. When it comes to professional gaming, there is always a chance that something controversial will happen. So, when xqc decided to stop gambling on stream, some people were surprised. But, what caused this?</p>
<p>To start with, it is important to understand what xqc was doing when he was gambling on stream. Essentially, he would bet skins on games such as CS:GO andPUBG. These skins can be thought of as in-game items that can be used to customize characters or weapons. While they have no real monetary value, they can be sold for money on websites like OPSkins. In fact, at the time of writing this article, the most expensive item on OPSkins is a knife that was worth $61,000.</p>
<p>So why did xqc stop gambling on stream? Well, it seems that one particular incident may have been the catalyst for his decision. In March 2018, xqc was streaming PUBG when he decided to gamble his entire inventory (which was worth over $6,000). Unfortunately for him, he lost and ended up having to give away all of his items. This may not seem like a big deal to some people, but it’s important to remember that xqc is a full-time professional gamer. So, losing all of those items could have had a significant impact on his income.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that xqc is not the only pro gamer who has stopped gambling on stream recently. In fact, just a few weeks ago both summit1g and shroud stopped gambling after allegations were made that they had been cheating while gambling. So why did these accusations cause summit1g and shroud to stop gambling? Well, it seems that they were afraid of being banned from Twitch (the website where they stream).</p>
<p>Ultimately, there are a few reasons why xqc stopped gambling on stream. Firstly, he may have been concerned about how it could impact his income. Secondly, the incident where he lost all of his items may have been the final straw for him. And finally, summit1g and shroud may have stopped gambling because they were afraid of being banned from Twitch.</p>
<h1 id="xqc’s-reason-for-stopping-gambling-on-stream"><a href="#xqc’s-reason-for-stopping-gambling-on-stream" class="headerlink" title="xqc’s reason for stopping gambling on stream"></a>xqc’s reason for stopping gambling on stream</h1><p>Hey everyone, this is xqc. I’m writing this to give my reasoning for why I will no longer be gambling on stream. It’s not because I don’t enjoy it or because I think it’s wrong; it’s simply because of how it’s been affecting me mentally and emotionally.</p>
<p>Ever since I started streaming, I’ve been gambling on stream. Initially, it was just a way to have some fun and pass the time. However, lately it’s been having a negative impact on my mental health. Gambling has become an obsession and a way to cope with my anxiety and stress. This has resulted in me making some poor decisions both in and out of the casino.</p>
<p>It’s time for me to take a step back from gambling and focus on my mental health. I hope you can all understand and support me in this decision. Thank you for reading.</p>
<h1 id="xqc’s-explanation-for-why-he-stopped-gambling-on-stream"><a href="#xqc’s-explanation-for-why-he-stopped-gambling-on-stream" class="headerlink" title="xqc’s explanation for why he stopped gambling on stream"></a>xqc’s explanation for why he stopped gambling on stream</h1><p>I’m xqc, and I used to gamble on stream a lot. I thought I’d do a quick write-up of why I stopped.</p>
<p>First and foremost, it was affecting my ability to focus on the game. Whenever I had a bet going on, I was extremely nervous and it would take away from my ability to play well. This is especially true because I tended to gamble on matches that were close or had a lot of money on the line (20+ viewers).</p>
<p>Second, it was becoming too stressful. I would wake up in the middle of the night worrying about how much money I had lost gambling or what match I had next that I could potentially lose money on. This led to me being very stressed out during the day, which took away from my ability to focus on the game.</p>
<p>Third, it was creating drama with other people in the community. There were times when people would start betting against me in matches or spreading rumors about how much money I had lost. This created a lot of discord within the community and ultimately just made everyone miserable.</p>
<p>Fourth, it was making me unhappy. The main reason I started gambling on stream was because it made me happy. Whenever I won, it felt like an adrenaline rush and it was a great feeling. However, as time went on, the thrill of winning diminished and all that was left was misery and unhappiness.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these are some of the reasons why I stopped gambling on stream. It’s not because I think gambling is bad or wrong - in fact, I still think it can be fun - but rather because it was negatively impacting my life in various ways. Thank you for reading!</p>
