# What is the Magic Apple Hold and Win?

The Magic Apple Hold and Win is a game that is based on the popular children's story, "The Tortoise and the Hare." The premise of the game is simple - the player must race their tortoise to the finish line before their opponent's tortoise. The player can win by either crossing the finish line first or by trapping their opponent's tortoise in a magic apple.

To play, each player needs a toy tortoise, a magic apple, and two coins. The magic apple is placed in the middle of the playing area and each player selects a corner to start from. Players take turns moving their tortoise forward one space at a time. If they land on the space with the magic apple, they can choose to either eat the apple or use it to trap their opponent's tortoise. If they choose to eat the apple, they automatically win the game. If they choose to use it to trap their opponent's tortoise, they must roll the two coins. If both coins come up as heads, then their opponent's tortoise is trapped and they automatically win the game. If only one coin comes up as a head, then their opponent has successfully escaped and can continue playing. The first player to reach the finish line wins the game.

# How do you play the Magic Apple Hold and Win?

The object of the game is to collect as many points as possible by holding onto the magic apple for as long as possible. The first player to reach 1000 points or more wins the game.

To play, each player starts with 10 apples. The player with the most apples at the end of the game wins.

The player with the most apples starts by picking up an apple and saying, "I hold and I win!" The next player then picks up an apple and says, "I hold and I win!" Players continue taking turns picking up apples and saying this until one player either doesn't have any more apples left or decides to end the turn by putting down an apple and saying, "I pass."

If a player has no more apples left, that player is out of the game. The last player who still has apples is the winner.

If a player puts down an apple and says, "I pass," that player can't pick up any more apples for the rest of the game. However, that player can still keep any apples they have already collected.

# What are the odds of winning the Magic Apple Hold and Win?

In the Magic Apple Hold and Win scratch-off game, the player must match three symbols in a row to win the top prize. In total, there are nine ways to win, with prizes ranging from $2 to $50,000. What are the odds of winning the top prize?

To calculate the odds of winning the top prize, we need to know how many combinations of three symbols there are. This can be done using permutations:

\[ n! \over (n - r)! \]

In this equation, \(n\) is the number of symbols and \(r\) is the number of symbols that have already been matched. For our scratch-off game, \(n\) is 3 and \(r\) is 2, so the equation becomes:

\[ 3! \over (3 - 2)! = 6 \]

This means that there are six different ways to match three symbols in a row. Out of all of these combinations, only one will win the top prize. This means that the odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 6.
