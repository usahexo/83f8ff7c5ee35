#  Who is Goehte?

Goehte was born in 1748 and died in 1832. He was a German writer and philosopher.

Goehte is considered one of the most important German writers and philosophers of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He was greatly influenced by the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Goehte's most famous work is probably his treatise on aesthetics, "Zur Lehre von den aesthetischen Formen" (On the Doctrine of Aesthetic Forms), which he published in 1800.

In this work, Goehte attempted to develop a systematic theory of art based on Kant's idea that beauty is a property of objects that arises from their form or structure, not from their individual features. In opposition to the prevailing Romantic aestheticism, Goehte argued for the objective validity of art and for the view that art should be judged according to its own standards, not according to the personal preferences of individual viewers.

#  Why are they important?

Markdown is an important tool for content creators because it makes the writing process easier and faster. With markdown, you can create formatted text without the need for any additional software.

# How does it work?

Markdown is a very simple markup language that uses plain text to format documents. To create formatted text, you simply add symbols before and after the text you want to format. For example, to create a heading, you add a # symbol before and after the text. To create a list, you add a - symbol before and after each item.

This makes it easy to write quickly without having to worry about formatting or layout. You can focus on the content instead of the presentation. And when it's time to publish your work, you can easily convert your markdown into HTML or another formats.

# Why is it popular?

Markdown has become popular because it's simple and fast to use. It's perfect for creating content on the go, and it doesn't require any special software or training. Anyone can learn how to use markdown in just a few minutes.
