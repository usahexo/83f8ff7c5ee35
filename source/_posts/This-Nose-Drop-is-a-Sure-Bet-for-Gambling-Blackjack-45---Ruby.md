#  The Secret to Winning at Gambling Blackjack 45 - Ruby with Nose Drop

In any casino game, the house always has an edge. This is a mathematical certainty, regardless of the game. However, there are still ways to tip the odds in your favor and increase your chances of winning. In blackjack, this can be done by following a few simple rules.

The first thing to keep in mind is to never split 10s or 5s. Splitting these cards will only make your odds worse, as you are then more likely to bust. Instead, always hit on 10s and stand on 5s.

Another rule to follow is to never take insurance. Insurance is only a good bet if the dealer has an Ace up and is therefore likely to have a blackjack. Since this is not usually the case, taking insurance is usually not a wise decision.

When deciding whether to hit or stand, always remember that the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. dealer must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more). This means that if you have a hand of 16 and the dealer has a face card showing, you should hit – even if you would normally stand on that hand.

Finally, always remember that the house edge still exists, no matter how good of a player you may be. There will be times when you will lose no matter what you do, so don’t gamble more than you can afford to lose.
