#  Winner of the $1 million Mega Millions Jackpot was Found Sitting on a Barstool!

Just another day in the life of a barstool millionaire!

That's how 37-year-old Shane Missler described his winnings after he hit the jackpot earlier this year. Sitting on a barstool at his favorite spot, Shane chatted with friends about how he was going to use his new fortune—the $1 million Mega Millions Jackpot.

Shane wasn't sure what to do with such a large sum of money, but he knew that he wanted to make a difference in the lives of others. He has already started by donating $100,000 to the Morris Animal Foundation, which funds animal health research projects all over the world.

He also plans to set up a trust fund for his brother and give money to his other family members. But Shane isn't just interested in helping those close to him—he wants to help others who are less fortunate as well.

He has already pledged $10,000 to help support victims of the recent mass shooting in Florida. And that's just the beginning! Shane says he is excited about using his new wealth to make a positive impact on the world. What an amazing way to start off 2018!

#  Wherever Is the Barstool Gambling Home? 
After a few years of the “legalized” sports gambling at the state level, there is much discussion about the future of online gambling. The NBA has come out in support of legalized sports betting. This is in line with the opinion of other leagues such as MLB and NHL. They feel that they have lost revenue because the black market is more popular.

It is estimated that over $150 billion is illegally wagered on sports every year. However, not everyone agrees that legalizing gambling is a good thing. Many church groups and others who see gambling as a vice are against it. They are afraid that legalization will lead to an increase in addiction problems.

There is no one clear answer to this question. Each person’s opinion will likely be based on his or her personal experiences with gambling. For some, legalizing it will lead to more problems. For others, it will simply mean that they can place their bets legally instead of having to go through a bookie or other illegal avenue.

#  Why Sit at a Desk When You Can Sit at a Barstool? 

Do you find yourself sitting at a desk all day long? Are you looking for a way to break up the monotony of your workday? If so, you may want to consider sitting at a barstool instead.

Here are some of the benefits of sitting at a barstool:

1. You’ll get more exercise.

When you sit at a barstool, you’ll be constantly moving and adjusting your position. This is great for your health, as it helps you get more exercise throughout the day.

2. You’ll be more productive.

Sitting in one position for hours on end can be really tedious and unproductive. When you switch things up by sitting at a barstool, you’ll be more alert and motivated to get things done.

3. You’ll feel more relaxed.

Sitting in an upright position all day can be really tense and uncomfortable. When you sit at a barstool, you can relax into the curve of the seat and enjoy some much-needed relief.

4. You’ll have better posture.

When you sit at a desk, it’s easy to slouch or hunch over your keyboard. This can lead to bad posture and various health problems down the road. When you sit at a barstool, you’ll be forced to maintain good posture due to the height of the seat.

5. You’ll feel more social.

Sitting at a desk all day can make you feel lonely and isolated from your coworkers. When you sit at a barstool instead, you’ll be in close proximity to others and will likely feel more socialized throughout the day.

#  The Surprising Place That's Becoming America's Favorite Gambling Hub

During the past several years, a surprising place in America has become the country's favorite gambling hub. Gambling proponents once thought that only Las Vegas could draw in big crowds of people looking to gamble, but it turns out that Atlantic City is giving the Nevada city a run for its money.

Atlantic City first became popular as a seaside resort town in the 1800s. It wasn't until 1978 that casino gambling was legalized in New Jersey, and it was Atlantic City's Boardwalk casinos that started taking bets from people. The city grew in popularity as a gambling destination and reached its peak in 2006 when five of the twelve casinos in the city were generating over $1 billion in revenue each year.

However, things went downhill from there. A spate of casino closures caused Atlantic City's gambling revenues to plummet by more than half between 2006 and 2014. In an effort to revive Atlantic City's gaming industry, New Jersey authorized new forms of gaming such as internet gambling and sports betting. These efforts have been somewhat successful, with gambling revenues in Atlantic City increasing for three consecutive years through 2017.

Why is Atlantic City seeing a resurgence in popularity as a gambling destination? There are several reasons. First, Atlantic City has been able to offer more gaming options than Las Vegas, with more variety in terms of types of games (e.g., poker, blackjack, slots) and betting limits. Second, Atlantic City is much closer to large population centers on the east coast than Las Vegas is for west coast residents. And third, thanks to its location on the Boardwalk and its beachfront attractions, Atlantic City offers tourists a complete vacation experience beyond just gambling.

The future looks bright for Atlantic City's casino industry. In 2018, two new casinos will be opening in the city (the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Atlantic City and Ocean Resort Casino), which is expected to help drive continued growth in gambling revenues. So if you're looking for a great place to gamble in America, be sure to add Atlantic City to your list!
