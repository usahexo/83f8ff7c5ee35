Each bet has a different payout, which is how much money will be paid out to the player if they win the bet. learning how to calculate roulette payouts is important for players who want to make informed decisions about where to place their bets.

The payout calculation for betting on two numbers is also easy to compute. The player wagers $5 on two adjacent numbers and if they win, they receive $15 back plus their original stake of $5, for a total payout of $20.

For imagine betting on three numbers, the calculations become more complex because there are multiple ways to win. In this case, the player might wager $5 on three numbers in any one row on the layout. If one of those numbers comes up, then the player receives $15 back plus their original stake of $5 for a total payout of $20. If two of those numbers come up, then the player receives $30 back plus their original stake of $5 for a total payout of $35. And if all three numbers come up, then the player receives back their original stake of $5 as well as an additional payment of $105 for a total payout of$110.
