1. The U.S. military pulled out of Afghanistan on October 15th, 2014, amid questions about the future of the blackjack deck in the region.

2. The blackjack deck has been a factor in the Afghanistan conflict since 2001, when U.S. forces invaded the country in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

3. There are several reasons why the blackjack deck is still a factor in the Afghanistan conflict, despite the U.S. military's withdrawal from the country.

4. First, the Taliban continue to pose a threat to Afghan security forces and civilians. The Taliban are believed to have close ties to Al Qaeda, and they remain determined to overthrow the Afghan government and establish a fundamentalist Islamic state in the country.

5. Second, Afghanistan is still a major source of heroin production and trafficking. The United States has invested significant resources in combating heroin production in Afghanistan, and it is likely that these efforts will continue even after the U.S. military withdraws from the country.

6. Finally, there are concerns that Afghanistan may become a haven for terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS once U.S. forces leave the country. These groups could use Afghanistan as a base of operations for planning attacks against the United States and its allies abroad
