#  How to Rank Your Poker Hands

In the game of poker, there are various hands that can be made. The rank of these hands determines how likely you are to win the hand. In this article, we will rank the hands from the weakest to the strongest and explain why each hand ranks where it does.

The weakest hand in poker is two pair. This is because it has little chance of winning against any other hand. The second weakest hand is a pair of Jacks or lower. This hand has a bit better chance of winning than two pair but is still not very strong. Next up is three of a kind which is stronger than a pair but still not as strong as a full house. A full house is made up of three of a kind and a pair, making it one of the strongest hands in poker.

After that, we have four of a kind which is stronger than a full house. Next up is a straight, which is stronger than four of a kind but weaker than a flush. A flush is made up of five cards all of the same suit, making it one of the strongest possible hands in poker. Following that, we have a straight flush, which is an even stronger variant of a flush. The strongest possible hand in poker is a royal flush, which consists of 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace all in the same suit.
