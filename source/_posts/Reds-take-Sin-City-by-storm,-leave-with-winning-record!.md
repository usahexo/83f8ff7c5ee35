#  Reds take Sin City by storm, leave with winning record!

The Cincinnati Reds kicked off their five-game road trip in style, taking all three games against the Las Vegas Aviators. The Reds started the series off with a bang, scoring six runs in the first inning of their game on Thursday night. They never looked back, cruising to an easy 10-4 victory. On Friday night, they relied on more late inning heroics, this time plating four runs in the top of the 9th inning to secure an 8-6 victory. Sonny Gray was dominant on the mound for Cincinnati, striking out nine batters over 6 innings of work. The Reds wrapped up the series with a dominant 7-1 victory on Sunday afternoon.

Despite being one of the worst teams in baseball last season, the Reds have looked like a completely different team in 2019. Led by Joey Votto and Eugenio Suarez, they have scored more runs than any other team in baseball so far this season. And while their pitching has not been as strong as their offense, they have still managed to win six of their first nine games.

The Reds now head to San Francisco for a four-game series against the Giants. San Francisco has had a disappointing start to the season, currently sitting at just 4-8 on the year. This is a series that Cincinnati should be able to win if they continue playing like they have been so far this season.

#  5 tips on how to win while gambling in Las Vegas 

Las Vegas is a city that is built on gambling. Sin City, as it is sometimes called, is a top destination for those looking to gamble and have some fun. Here are five tips on how to win while gambling in Las Vegas:

Tip 1: Do Your Research
Before you even step foot in Las Vegas, be sure to do your research on the games you want to play. Each game has its own odds and strategies, so make sure you know what you’re doing before placing any bets.

Tip 2: Stick to Lower-Risk Games
If you’re a beginner gambler or don’t want to risk too much money, stick to lower-risk games like blackjack, roulette or craps. These games have relatively lower odds than other casino games, but they still offer the chance to win big payouts.

Tip 3: Play at the Right Casino
Not all casinos in Las Vegas are created equal – some have better odds than others. When choosing a casino to play at, be sure to do your research and find one with favourable odds. This will increase your chances of winning while gambling.

Tip 4: Make Strategic Bets
When playing casino games, it’s important to make strategic bets in order to increase your chances of winning. For example, in blackjack, always bet on the dealer busting if you have less than 17 points. This is one of the best ways to improve your odds while playing this game.

Tip 5: Stay Patient and Don’t Rush Things
One of the biggest mistakes that gamblers make is rushing things. If you want to win while gambling in Las Vegas, it’s important to stay patient and take your time. Rushing through your decision can lead to costly mistakes – something you definitely want to avoid when playing for real money stakes.
