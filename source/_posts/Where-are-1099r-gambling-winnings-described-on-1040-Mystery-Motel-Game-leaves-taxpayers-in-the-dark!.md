The Mystery Motel Game, a recent craze sweeping the nation, has left taxpayers in the dark on where to report gambling winnings from the game. The game, which involves staying in a mystery motel room and guessing what room you are in, can be extremely lucrative for players lucky enough to guess correctly. But where exactly are the winnings reported on tax returns?

The 1099-R form is typically used to report gambling winnings and losses, but it's not clear whether or not this form would apply to the Mystery Motel Game. The game is classified as a wager, but the IRS has not yet released any guidance on how to report winnings from the game. In the meantime, taxpayers are left in limbo as to how to report their winnings.

Some experts have suggested reporting the winnings as Other Income on Line 21 of Form 1040. This line is generally used to report income such as interest, dividends, and capital gains. However, others have argued that this line should not be used for gambling winnings because it's not specifically designated for that purpose.

Another option is to report the winnings as Non-Taxable Income on Line 21 of Form 1040NR. This option is available to those who itemize their deductions and claim gambling losses on Schedule A. However, many people are unsure if they can claim these losses since the Mystery Motel Game is considered a wager and not a true gamble.

As of now, there is no clear guidance from the IRS on how to report gambling winnings from the Mystery Motel Game. Until this changes, taxpayers will be left guessing as to how best report their earnings from this popular new game.

#  Taxpayers beware: The Mystery Motel Game doesn't describe 1099r gambling winnings on 1040!

The Mystery Motel Game is an IRS-sanctioned, $50 billion per year, tax shelter game that doesn't appear to be described anywhere on the 1040 form! The game works like this: each taxpayer (or group of taxpayers) checks into a motel, pays the bill, and then subtracts their "motel losses" from their "gambling wins."

The problem is that there's no mention of the game on the 1040 form, and it's not clear how the IRS would treat winning tickets purchased as part of this game. A recent article in Forbes suggests that the IRS might not even consider this to be gambling income at all!

This creates a huge potential for tax avoidance, and taxpayers should beware! If you're playing the Mystery Motel Game, make sure you keep careful records of your losses and wins, and be prepared to defend your deductions if the IRS comes calling.

#  Find out where to report your 1099r gambling winnings on form 1040.

When you receive a 1099r form from the casino or gambling establishment, it's important to report the income on your tax form. The good news is that most of the time, gambling winnings are considered taxable income. The bad news is that there are a few exceptions. So where do you report your casino or gambling winnings on your 1040?

The place to report gambling income on your 1040 is on line 21, under Other Income. Simply enter the amount of your winnings on the appropriate line. If you have multiple 1099r forms, add up all of the amounts and enter that total on line 21.

There are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to reporting gambling income. First, only gambling income that is considered taxable should be reported on line 21. This includes winnings from slot machines, blackjack, roulette, and other casino games. It also includes lottery winnings and betting or wagering proceeds.

However, there are some exceptions. Gambling losses can be deducted from gambling income, but only up to the amount of taxable income generated by the winnings. In other words, if you have $1,000 in taxable gambling income and $500 in losses, you can only deduct $500 of the losses from your income. And if you have no other source of income, your net gambling loss cannot be claimed as a deduction on your tax return.

In addition, certain expenses related to gambling can also be deducted from your taxable income. These include transportation costs to and from the casino or racetrack, as well as any meals or lodging incurred while at the casino or race track. However, these deductions are only allowed if they are not also claimed as business expenses. So if you're self-employed and incur these costs while traveling for work, they cannot be deducted as gambling-related expenses.

It's important to remember that just because you received a 1099r form from a casino or other gaming institution doesn't mean that all of your gambling income is taxable. There are a few exemptions and deductions available that can help reduce your tax liability. But in most cases, any winnings over $600 will be considered taxable income and should be reported on line 21 of form 1040.
