# What Exactly Happens if Ball Lands Upon Green in Roulette Wheel at Oxbet

Roulette is one of the most exciting casino games, and Oxbet offers a great online platform for you to enjoy this game from the comfort of your own home. The objective of the game is simple – you have to predict the number or color that the ball will land on when the roulette wheel comes to a stop. 

The roulette wheel has 37 pockets numbered from 0 to 36. The numbers are alternately colored in red and black, with the 0 being green. The green 0 is what sets the game of roulette apart from other casino games, as it gives the house an edge over the players. 

But what happens if the ball lands on the green 0 in the roulette wheel at Oxbet? Well, it depends on the type of bet you have placed. Let’s take a look at the different bets and their outcomes:

## Inside Bets

Inside bets are the bets placed on the numbers within the roulette layout. These bets offer higher payouts but have lower odds of winning. 

1. **Straight Up Bet**: This bet is placed on a single number. If the ball lands on the number you bet on, the payout is 35:1. If the ball lands on the green 0, you lose your bet.

2. **Split Bet**: This bet is placed on two adjacent numbers. If the ball lands on either of the two numbers, the payout is 17:1. If the ball lands on the green 0, you lose your bet.

3. **Street Bet**: This bet is placed on three numbers in a row. If the ball lands on any of the three numbers, the payout is 11:1. If the ball lands on the green 0, you lose your bet.

4. **Corner Bet**: This bet is placed on four numbers that meet at a corner. If the ball lands on any of the four numbers, the payout is 8:1. If the ball lands on the green 0, you lose your bet.

5. **Six-Line Bet**: This bet is placed on two adjacent rows of numbers, covering six numbers in total. If the ball lands on any of the six numbers, the payout is 5:1. If the ball lands on the green 0, you lose your bet.

## Outside Bets

Outside bets are the bets placed outside the numbers layout. These bets offer lower payouts but have higher odds of winning.

1. **Red/Black Bet**: This bet is placed on the color of the number the ball will land on. If the ball lands on the color you bet on, the payout is 1:1. If the ball lands on the green 0, you lose your bet.

2. **Even/Odd Bet**: This bet is placed on the parity of the number the ball will land on. If the ball lands on the parity you bet on, the payout is 1:1. If the ball lands on the green 0, you lose your bet.

3. **High/Low Bet**: This bet is placed on whether the ball will land on a high number (19-36) or a low number (1-18). If the ball lands on the range you bet on, the payout is 1:1. If the ball lands on the green 0, you lose your bet.

In conclusion, if the ball lands on the green 0 in the roulette wheel at Oxbet, you lose your bet, unless you have placed an additional bet on the green 0 specifically. Now that you know what happens if the ball lands on green, head over to Oxbet and try your luck at the roulette table!
