#  New York Giants' 4 Square Gambling Ban Lifted

On Wednesday, a New York appeals court lifted the state's 4 square gambling ban, which could lead to a resurgence of the game in schools and parks across the state.

4 square, also known as captain's ball, is a simple game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It is played with a rubber ball and typically involves two or more players. The object of the game is to keep the ball in play by hitting it against the ground and into other players' squares. The last player to successfully hit the ball into play is out, and the game continues until one player is left standing.

The popularity of 4 square has waned in recent years, in large part due to New York's ban on the game. With the ban now lifted, we can expect to see a resurgence of 4 square throughout the state. Teachers, parents, and students are already beginning to organize tournaments and other events to celebrate this exciting news.

So what are you waiting for? Grab a rubber ball and head to your nearest park or school yard to start playing 4 square!
